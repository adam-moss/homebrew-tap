This is a [Homebrew](https://www.brew.sh) [Tap](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/brew-tap.md) containing 
a collection of formula that for one reason or another can not be added into 
the [offical repositories](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/Interesting-Taps-%26-Forks.md).

There are many like it, but this one is mine.

standard `brew` commands.
